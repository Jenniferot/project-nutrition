# Project Nutrition
Par programming - Anna Gustafsson and Jennifer Thors√©n
Build an app in react using redux which scans barcodes on food packages to retrieve the product name and nutritional information.
The data is fetched from the Open world facts api. 

We choose to display data together with daily recommendations for five different nutrients.
We are using Styled components for styling.
Quagga is used to scan the barcode.

## The problem
The Api was not a friend of ours.
